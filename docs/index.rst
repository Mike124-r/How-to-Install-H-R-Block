This full guide tells you all you need to know about installing H&R Block software on Windows and Mac computers, as well as how to fix typical problems that come up during installation.

Why do you need to install H&R Block software?
H&R Block lets you file your taxes online, but the desktop software gives you more control, lets you work offline, and has more advanced features for complicated tax situations. The installed version has the following benefits:

The ability to function without being connected to the internet

Saving more than one return on your device

Access to tools and calculators for tax preparation

Getting W-2s, 1099s, and old H&R Block files into the system

Local storage makes files safer.

Installation is the best method to go for people who want to work directly on their PC or Mac.

What You'll Need Before You Install
Get the following things together to make sure the setup goes smoothly:

A legitimate purchase of H&R Block software, either on CD or as a digital download

A device that works with Windows or Mac

Information about your operating system (make sure it is up to date)

At least 170MB of space on your hard drive is free.

A stable internet connection (for updates and activation)

Your product activation code, which you can usually find in the box or email you got when you bought it,

Having these information ready will make the installation go faster.

How to Install on Windows in Steps
Step 1: Put in the CD or download the installer.
Put the installation disc into your computer's CD/DVD drive if you bought a physical copy. If you ordered a digital edition, you can get the installer file from H&R Block's website or the email you got to confirm your purchase.

Step 2: Open the Setup File
To start the installation, double-click the file (typically called HRBlock_Setup.exe) once the installer is ready.

Step 3: Do what the screen says to do.
A wizard for setting things up will show up. Click "Install" after agreeing to the terms and conditions and choosing where to install it.

Step 4: Type in the Product Code
After installation, start the software. It will ask you for your product activation code so that you can use all of its capabilities.

Step 5: Update the software
The software will look for updates. To make sure you have the most up-to-date tax forms and corrections, download and install any updates that are available.

How to Install on a Mac
Step 1: Get the Software
Most of the time, Mac users will download the software digitally instead of getting a CD. Find the .dmg file and download it.

Step 2: Open the Installer by double-clicking the file you downloaded. You will see a box that lets you drag the H&R Block icon into your Applications folder.

Step 3: Finish the installation
Once it's in Applications, double-click the icon to open the program. Accept the conditions of the license and move on.

Step 4: Type in your activation code
You will need to enter your product key to completely activate the software and use all of its capabilities, just like you do with Windows.

Step 5: Get the updates.
To make sure the program works right and meets the needs of the current tax year, check for updates and install them.

Problems and Solutions for Installing
Problem: The installation won't start

Solution: Restart your computer and try again. If you're downloading something, make sure the file isn't broken by downloading it again.

The problem is that the activation code is not valid.

Fix: Make sure the code you typed in is correct. If the problems don't go away, call H&R Block customer service and have your proof of purchase ready.

Problem: The software crashes or stops working.

Fix: Make sure your device fulfills the minimum system requirements and upgrade your OS.

Can't install on a Mac:

Fix: Check that the app was made by a trusted developer. Under "Security & Privacy" in your system options, you might need to let the installation happen.

Advice for a Smooth Experience
Keep your product key in a secure place; you'll need it to reinstall or use it again in the future.

Make copies of your tax returns so you don't lose them.

Install early so that you can fix any technical problems long before the tax deadline.

For help with tax inquiries or technical issues, use the software's built-in support tools.

During tax season, it's important to keep your software up to date, especially if you file late or change your return.

What to Do After Installation
You can start getting ready for tax season as soon as you install and activate your H&R Block software. The software asks you easy questions to get you through each step and fills out the tax papers you need.

You will be able to:

Import the returns from last year

Upload your 1099 and W-2 documents

Use calculators to figure out how much you can deduct.

File your taxes online or by mail.
